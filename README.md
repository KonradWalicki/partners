Repository to help the Profisee partners deploy a clean instance of our product.

As a Profisee Partner, we hope you will use this repository to learn how to use Profisee.  You may deploy these assets to any IaaS, PaaS or SaaS environment that you have an admin account for.

Steps:
1) Download, Install and Configure Profisee. All the documentation can be found here: https://support.profisee.com/
2) Download and Install "ProfiseePlatformTools_20****.msi" from the downloads folder on https://support.profisee.com/  (this  is also known as the Profisee Command Line Utility or CLU)
3) In the main Github page, the top right corner should have a green button saying "<> Code". Click on that icon and there you should have a few options to download the repository. Pick one and download the entire repository.
4) Run Profisee Command Line Utility to import the assets and deploy the data.
