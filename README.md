Repository to help the Profisee partners deploy a clean instance of our product.

As a Profisee Partner, we hope you will use this repository to learn how to use Profisee.

Steps:
1) Download, Install and Configure Profisee. All the documentation can be found here: https://support.profisee.com/
2) Donload and Install "ProfiseePlatformTools_20****.msi"
3) In the main page, the top right corner should have a green button saying "<> Code". Click on that icon and there you should have a few options to download the repository. Pick one and download the entire repository.
4) Create a folder in your "C:\" driver using the following structure "C:\Temp\contoso". Optionally you can change the "deploy.bat" file with the correct folder location.
5) You will find a file called "deploy.bat". Update that file with your own information. 
6) Run the "deploy.bat" file using CMD.exe in Administration Mode.
